# Noted!

A simple notes and todo app, written with Flutter. This app is written mostly with Android platform in mind as I don't have access to a Mac, and I also only use linux for testing purposes. Although the app should at least compile for other platforms as well, including Mac OS, Windows, Web and IOS.

TODO:
- ~~Change the settings page's Dropdowns to Material Alert Dialogs~~
- ~~Add state restoration~~
- ~~Use Navigation 2/Go Route (?)~~ (Postponed because currently Go_Router doesn't support state restoration of the sub-routes)
- Add sharing functionality
- Complete the widget tests
- Add Undo/Redo

Design and overall suggestions are welcome!

I wrote this when Flutter v2 was around, and I changed a few things to make sure that it works well for the most part with Flutter v3, but some new bugs might be introduced here. Let me know if you have found one! :)
